integrating companies that could take SJS to the next level of growth.",Positive,Medium

numbers, which includes Walter Pack India, 36% revenue contribution would be from two 
wheelers, 36% from passenger vehicles and 28% from consumer appliances and others.",Neutral,Low

Exotech and Walter Pack acquisition have helped us to balance our portfolio concentration from 
a large two wheeler player to an overall automotive and consumer appliances player.",Positive,Low

business at a good valuation, but at the same time achieved many key strategic objectives in 
terms of addition of new and emerging technologies, new customers, manufacturing capabilities

at 539.8 million.",Neutral,Low
key_triggers,geopolitical,"However, I would like to inform you that we are seeing improvement in the export markets and 
our export revenue almost doubled for the quarter compared to last year same quarter which was 
impacted due to geopolitical issues in Europe and also macroeconomic slowdown in North

our export revenue almost doubled for the quarter compared to last year same quarter which was 
impacted due to geopolitical issues in Europe and also macroeconomic slowdown in North 
America.",Negative,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"The increase in export revenue this quarter is largely due to winning new businesses with our 
existing customers in South America and EMEA.",Positive,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"This bounce back in export 
revenue will definitely help us grow further and it reinstates our belief that exports will be one 
of the core growth drivers for our company in the future.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"As you all know, consolidated revenue at Rs.1,172.5 million has 
grown at 13.6% YoY on the back of strong growth in automotive segment and exports.",Positive,Medium
key_triggers,geopolitical,"Q1 FY24 export constitute 11% of 
consolidated sales compared to 6% of the sales last year, that was impacted due to external 
geopolitical and macroeconomic factors.",Negative,Low

margin of 26.1%.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"PAT at Rs.180 million grew 
11.1% YoY and PAT margin stood at 15.4%.",Neutral,Low

to Rs.310.38 million post preferential allotment to our promoter Mr. Joseph.",Neutral,Low

48.2%.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"Pro forma EBITDA margin were at 27.3%, witnessing 120 bps margin expansion as 
compared to Q1 FY24 reported margin.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"Pro forma EBITDA margin were at 27.3%, witnessing 120 bps margin expansion as 
compared to Q1 FY24 reported margin.",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"This would result in a PAT growth of 52.1% and EPS 
growth of 51.8% YoY. Even after considering the impact of lower other income and higher 
interest costs on loan taken for Walter Pack acquisition, then also our pro forma EPS would have 
been 21% higher than reported Q1 FY24 EPS, thereby highlighting the fact that Walter Pack 
India business will be EPS accretive for us.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"Moving ahead, we are absolutely on track in executing our organic 
growth strategy by addressing the aesthetic requirements of multiple end industry segments, 
increasing our global presence, introduction of new technology products and building mega 
customer accounts.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"On the Exotech capacity expansion front, we would like to update everyone that post the Walter 
Pack acquisition, we see many synergies between the two companies, Exotech and Walter Pack.",Positive,Medium
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"On the Exotech capacity expansion front, we would like to update everyone that post the Walter 
Pack acquisition, we see many synergies between the two companies, Exotech and Walter Pack.",Positive,Medium
growth_prospects,expansion,"Hence the company has deferred its 
chrome plating capacity expansion CAPEX plan by a year to calendar year '24.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"We are revising 
the expansion plans to align more effectively with the evolving business requirements of both 
Walter Pack and Exotech.",Positive,High
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"It is our consistent focus on innovation that has enabled us to stay ahead of the 
curve and be a preferred supplier to most of our customers.",Positive,Medium
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"SJS has already started accelerating its efforts to increase its value in both two-wheeler, 
passenger vehicle and consumer segments with the addition of new technology premium 
products.",Positive,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"We can see that growth playing out with the addition of chrome plated parts through 
Exotech and IML, IMD and IMF parts through the recent Walter Pack acquisition.",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"We are confident that even in the future, any acquisition we do, will 
open up a new possibility for us to achieve higher business growth and will be complementary 
or an extension to our existing businesses.",Positive,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"SJS will continue to deliver on its robust financial and operational guidance of FY24 with 50% 
YoY growth in the SJS consolidated revenues and a consolidated PAT growth of about 40% YoY 
with the addition of Walter Pack revenues and robust margin profile in our existing businesses.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"My first question is basically what was the contribution from new products in the consolidated 
revenue and what was it in FY23?",Positive,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"And sir, we understand that Exotech margins on QoQ has slightly dropped, possibly we 
understand that due to the new products development, trial runs and etc., So wanted to 
understand, what could be the sustainable annual margin and where do you see it in the next 
three years?",Negative,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"Mahendra Naredi: 
So Amit, as we already guided in the past, there was a small blip in this quarter, but, however 
Exotech will continue to perform 14% to 15% sustainable margin.",Negative,Medium
material_impact,profit_margins,"So the margins that are there are largely what are agreed with Exotech in the past and in the 
future we hope to increase our exposure to export customers where margins would be higher, 
but to be conservative, we are still maintaining our guidance about 14% - 15% EBITDA margins 
on a sustainable basis for the next 2-3 years.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"Next on the Exotech's new plant capacity expansion, I just missed the initial comment.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"No, it's not delayed, it's a conscious decision on our part, because when we guided you on 
expansion, we see a very robust demand coming in by cross selling Exotech products to existing 
SJS customers.",Positive,Low
material_impact,cost_projections,"Yes, in an outsourcing model, 
the raw material cost Is going up.",Negative,Medium
material_impact,cost_projections,"But at the same time, the manufacturing, the admin and 
employee cost will not increase to that extent.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"So overall at EBITDA level we believe that it will 
not have any impact, and in fact at the PAT level, we believe that our PAT will go up because we 
will not have depreciation.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,expansion,"So in terms of the scale of 
capacity expansion, are those numbers still holding even though it's postponed by a year or is 
the scale of revenues and CAPEX also likely to be change?",Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"If you can just throw some light in terms of 
the actual performance of the WPI in the quarter and how is it expected to over the next couple 
of years, what cash positions of the business will be, more outlook on the revenue and EBITDA 
for this particular company and what is the capacity currently and how is the revenue potential 
and how do we expect it to grow?",Positive,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"How has it been during the quarter and how do 
we see its revenue and EBITDA outlook over the next 2-3 years, and currently, what is the 
 
SJS Enterprises 
July 27, 2023 
 
capacity and how do you expect this capacity and revenue potential to improve in the medium 
term?",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,So Walter Pack India has done this quarter 356 million sales turnover with an EBITDA of 31.5%.,Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"The in-mold forming technology that Walter Pack has, they have very strong 
knowledge on tooling and in fact there are very few companies in the world which has that 
expertise.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,market_trends,"There is a trend of using IME and there 
is a trend to use also electronics and inside the ambient lighting of the car.",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"I believe some of the PV OEMs for whom SJS was a tier-2 supplier earlier, 
now becomes tier-1 post WPI acquisition.",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"So how has been the response from the customers and 
in terms of awarding new business after the acquisition, if you can throw some color on that?",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"So companies 
like Bajaj, Royal Enfield, Honda etc we are in the process of telling them what we could do with 
IML technology that could improve aesthetics, especially for the plastics forming assemblies of 
these bikes.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"So both for the EV segment and for the conventional IC engines, I think the IML 
and IMD technology that we have to offer, IME will piggyback on this, will find a lot of demand 
when the customer sees this.",Negative,Low
material_impact,cost_projections,"So I think we are competitive in terms of quality, 
cost and delivery, and that helps us win customer confidence to introduce us in more and more 
plants globally.",Positive,Medium
material_impact,cost_projections,"One is that there has been an 
increase in subcontracting employees which comes under our other expenses and the other 
reason is there is a one-time expense in terms of a provision made for interest on GST to the 
tune of Rs 8 million.",Negative,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,I think I misheard the number for the WPI revenue.,Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"Devanshi Dhruva: 
WPI revenue for this quarter grew 21% YoY to Rs 356 million.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"Since this is a new technology that the OEMs themselves are now trying to 
evaluate.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"But since this is a new 
technology, it will take time.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,The other part is that Walter Pack has IME technology.,Negative,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"We have a technology support agreement with Walter Pack Spain and Walter Pack Spain will be 
our technology partner really in terms of advising us how to implement IME in the listing IML 
and IMF products that we have in India.",Positive,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"They export parts to North America and that demand was 
subdued plus of course there was some delays in launching of a new product by the sanitaryware 
segment, we supply to Geberit.",Positive,Low
key_triggers,geopolitical,"In fact the entire last year, if you will see because of the geopolitical issues in Europe as well as 
macroeconomic issues in North America, exports had been impacted.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"So that's 
why we are seeing the growth coming back and export revenue has almost doubled this quarter 
as compared to last year same quarter.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"Just one question from my end is what is the consumer durable on 
the overall revenue and what is the growth profile in this quarter for consumer durable segment?",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"So consumer durables is a very important segment for us and we have made further inroads by 
this Walter Pack acquisition where we've added a new consumer product line to our portfolio 
which is the Fascia Plate that you have for modular switches.",Positive,Medium
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"Plus, this new technology areas both in terms of the 
Legrand business for modular switch plates, that's also consumer business and the IML 
businesses that we could do with the likes of Whirlpool and the other appliance manufacturers.",Positive,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"Secondly, our guidance of 50% revenue growth and 40% profit growth, but Walter Pack is a 
higher margin business, so it is margin-accretive.",Positive,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"So why would the profit growth be lower than 
revenue growth, what am I missing here?",Negative,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"In our last earnings call, I mentioned that we will be accelerating 
our growth footprint.",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"We are not so worried about EBITDA because we have a very consistent 
track record.",Positive,Medium
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"So typically what happens is that when you start a new product or product line 
 
SJS Enterprises 
July 27, 2023 
 
before you offer to a customer, you do a lot of trials internally.",Negative,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"So that impacts the EBITDA to 
a certain extent in the short term.",Positive,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"So our past track 
record if you see SJS standalone we do close to about 30% 32% of the EBITDA over the last 
five to six years and we've been steady in maintaining that.",Negative,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"Another is when we made the acquisition 
of Walter Pack, we have taken the loans for that.",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"So there will be interest cost on that plus our 
internal accrual or our cash balance has been used to fund this acquisition which was earlier 
generating income and now this income will be very negligible income in FY24.",Positive,Low
material_impact,cost_projections,"So there will be interest cost on that plus our 
internal accrual or our cash balance has been used to fund this acquisition which was earlier 
generating income and now this income will be very negligible income in FY24.",Positive,Low
material_impact,revenue_growth,"And on the 
WPI side, on the revenue target if you can give for FY24 - FY25, please?",Neutral,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"So as I said, the WPI is a great acquisition for us.",Positive,High
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"There is a technology support agreement that 
is available to us.",Positive,Medium
growth_prospects,expansion,"So 
that is a great growth opportunity for us moving forward.",Positive,High
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"We are also, as I mentioned earlier, the 
IME technology that we will ride on that is something that we will do.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"So this just adds some additional opportunity for Walter Pack 
technology to be used for these customers.",Neutral,Low
growth_prospects,product_innovation,"So cross selling, exports and penetrating the Indian 
market faster with new technology products like IME.",Positive,Low
strategic_changes,acquisitions,"However, we won't be able to give any guidance in terms of Walter Pack 
currently because the acquisition has just got completed.",Positive,Medium
material_impact,revenue_growth,"So at the optimum utilization capacity of WPI, how much revenue we can 
generate?",Positive,Medium
material_impact,revenue_growth,"Currently, we are at a capacity utilization of 60% to 70% and we can generate revenue close to 
Rs.200 crores.",Neutral,Low
key_triggers,geopolitical,"Can you please 
tell us these customers are from domestic or international markets?",Neutral,Low
material_impact,profit_margins,"And secondly, are we going 
to see some impact on the margins due to the strategic step and sustainability of the margin if 
you can tell us on the annual basis for SJS standalone please?",Negative,Low
